[2.0.3-20030804- use select()]
(add)use select() for time out detection under Vxworks,in SocketConnection.cpp; RawReceive,Receive,Send


[2.0.3-20030730- Undo Set Priroity -1 for _service]

[2.0.3-20030729- Set Priroity -1 for _service]
Set Priroity -1 for _service before it stops

[2.0.3-20030625- Multicast group]
(add) broadcast support to UDP socket init()
(modify) support multiple multicast groups simultaneously by JoinGroup() & LeaveGroup();

[2.0.3-20030621- Multicast group]
(modify) Block out the use of UDP from SockHead.h, use UdpSocket.h instead
(Add) Support UDP Tx and Rx of IP multicast group into UdpSocket.h
	multicast group address: 224.x.x.x(E0.x.x.x) - 239.x.x.x(EF.x.x.x)

[2.0.2-20030617- Add new interface:Ping]

[2.0.2-20030609- Add new interface:IsReadable]
virtual bool IsReadable(DWORD dwTimeout) = 0;//in millisecond time out
can tell if there is data to recevie;
if false;to invoke IsBroken to can tell if the sock failed
 

[2.0.2-20030603- Endian of IP and Port]
0. Force the calling of SockInit()/SockClear() on Win32
1. Merge redundant and duplicated code
2. All IN/OUT IP are in NETWORK byte order
3. All IN/OUT Port are in HOST byte order.
4. Remvoe SockFunc.cpp from project

[2.0.1-20030528:add colon]
;//assert(false);//in SockConnection.cpp	

[2.0.1-20030528:HeadFilePosition]
Note:if you want include UdpSocket.h or sockhead.h 
in you file,you MUST include them prior to other head file,
otherwise there will be conflict with other files.
for exampel:
#include "UdpSocket.h"

#include "MyOtherHead.h"



[2.0.1-20030528:KeepAlive]
enable sending TCP keep-alive ACK for both TCP client and server by setsockopt

3.
select function:in Receive member function
prototype:int select (int nfds, fd_set *readfds, 
fd_set *writefds, 
fd_set *exceptfds, 
const struct timeval *timeout);
the first parameter is ignored on Windows,
and should be set to either the maximum file descriptor
value in use plus one, or simply to FD_SETSIZE on Vxworks.


[2.0.1-20030416:SetTos]
(bug):SetTos does not take effect on Windows 2000 by default;
	  if user wants to use it correctly on Windows 2000,please add a new key named DisableUserTOSSetting with value 0 
	  under following location:		
	  HKEY_LOCAL_ MACHINE on Local Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\;
	  
	  for more details,please refer to:	
	  http://support.microsoft.com:80/support/kb/articles/Q248/6/11.ASP&NoWebContent=1

	  SetTos works well on VxWorks.

[2.0.1-20030409:Thread]
(modify) Use CRunnable instead of taskSpawn or BeginThread or Sleep/Delay
(bug) SocketServer => taskSpawn should pair with a taskDelete
!!! Note !!!: dead TCP client connections clean up on CSocketServer::_Service 
				 may cause problem on bad behaviour client !!!
				it would be safer to do it on another thread.
